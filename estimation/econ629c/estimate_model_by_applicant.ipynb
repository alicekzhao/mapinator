    "Creating realistic models of matching markets allows us to make accurate performance assessments of these markets. These assessments allow us to answer interesting questions about market participants and how they match, such as whether matches satisfy participants' preferences and whether matches are affected by systemic discrimination. By analyzing how participant welfare depends on market design, we can then see whether these markets and their outcomes can be improved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bridging the gap between theory and data is crucial for creating realistic models. In existing theory, models of matching markets focus on participants who have types representing participant characteristics (Chade et al., 2017). These include discrete high/low qualities e.g. $\\theta \\in \\{H, L\\}$, or continuous qualities e.g. $\\theta \\in [0, 1]$. While these types may be observable by market participants, the econometrician or theorist studying these markets in practice may not be able to observe these types. Moreover, types used by real-world market participants may not reflect the more abstract examples above studied in previous literature.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the overall Mapinator project, we study the job market for graduates of economics Ph.D. programs. This market is a systematic, centralized process that has a structured timeline: Ph.D. students apply to jobs in the Fall, employers make offers to students in January and February, and a \"Secondary Scramble\" takes place in March where those who didn't match in January or February match together. There is an extensive placements dataset available for this market from the Mapinator (https://sage.microeconomics.ca/dash); while participant types and wages are not observable directly in this market, the outcomes of successful graduates are observable. Given this dataset, I focus on the question of whether we can recover candidates' and employers' unobservable types from the observable placements. Using these market parameters, we can then answer counterfactual questions of how the design of the job market affects the welfare of market participants.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook focuses on the tier classification estimation, which is required to estimate the unobservable types; it does not include estimation of the unobservable types themselves."

Moreover, sinks are not present in general frameworks such as those in Karrer & Newman (2011) or Peixoto (2014), which may create additional issues with applying Wang & Bickel (2017).

    "One property of this placements matrix not present in the previous placements matrix is that every entry is either zero or one as every applicant has at most one placement in their column, making the matrix compatible with Wang & Bickel (2017). However, because the departments are classified using the original placements matrix with entries greater than one, the full approach here is still not entirely compatible with the approach in Wang & Bickel (2017). Moreover, the departments are classified separately from candidates and the sinks are still present; these do not match general frameworks such as those in Karrer & Newman (2011) or Peixoto (2014), which may again create additional issues when trying to apply Wang & Bickel (2017)."

    "With the classification of departments taken as given, the candidates are classified into tiers based on where they were hired. This seems intuitive; unlike before, where applicants had common graduating departments and hiring employers, here applicants only have common hiring employers as applicants appear individually in the placements matrix. As a result, they can only cluster based on this information, which may result in the above matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several applicant clusters map to multiple academic tiers or sinks. Note that a classification where every hiring tier has a unique cluster of candidates is impossible as there are not enough candidate tiers. I ran some tests to see what would happen if additional candidate tiers were added: with a total of eight tiers, the minimum amount required for exact matching between hiring tiers and candidate tiers, exact matching does not occur. This also does not occur with nine tiers. With 15 tiers, there is exact matching with some redundant tiers, and with 10 tiers, there is exact matching with fewer redundant tiers. In some of these tests, several hiring tiers mapped to multiple candidate tiers; this could either be due to the algorithm identifying differences between the groups of candidates based on the exact hiring employers, or due to the algorithm reaching a local maximum during maximization of the likelihood. I provide the estimation with 10 candidate tiers later in this notebook.\n",

Each tier includes the departments whose graduates are in the tier, the number of graduates from the department who are in the tier, as well as the tier of the department from the previous department classification."

    "This notebook explores several different approaches to estimating the tiers of candidates and employers in the job market for economics Ph.D. graduates. Different approaches lead to different classification structures; clustering by departments and employers only results in a placement matrix similar to previous Mapinator project results such as those in [estimate_model.ipynb](https://github.com/jbrightuniverse/mapinator/blob/master/estimation/estimate_model.ipynb), whereas clustering by candidates results in a matching between hiring tiers and candidate tiers. The next steps would be to further establish the robustness of these approaches, estimate market parameters such as the market values of candidates, and use these estimates to study counterfactuals regarding the design of the market."
